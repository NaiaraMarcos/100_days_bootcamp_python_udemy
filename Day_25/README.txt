This project is about how to work with CSV files and analyze data with pandas. We create a game in which there is a blank map of the states of the USA.
You must guess the names of the 50 states of the USA.
Then the code checks if the state is in the CSV file and if this state exists, the name is put on the map using the coordinates that contain the file.
